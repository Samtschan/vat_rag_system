reclaim VAT if you offer your customers payments in advance instalments deposits or credit sales From HM Revenue Customs Published 1 July 2014 Last updated 28 February 2019 — See all updates Get emails about this page Contents Overview Tax points Advance payments and deposits Payments for continuous supplies Credit and conditional sales Reclaiming VAT when you use different payment methods Print this page Overview Your business might offer customers different ways to pay for goods or services These may include making advance payments paying in instalments credit sales both with and without the involvement of a finance company periodic payments for continuous supplies security deposits for goods hired out Tax points A tax point is the date you have to account for VAT on the sale of goods or the supply of services There are different types of tax points and you’ll need to make sure you get the right transaction on the right VAT Return Advance payments and deposits An advance payment or deposit is a proportion of the total selling price that a customer pays before you supply them with goods or services The tax point will be either the date you issue a VAT invoice for the advance payment or the date you receive the advance payment whichever happens first You include the VAT due on the advance payment on your VAT Return for the period when the tax point occurs If the customer pays you the remaining balance before the goods are delivered or the services are performed a further tax point is created This will be either when you issue a VAT invoice for the balance or when you receive payment of the balance whichever happens first You then include the VAT due on the balance on the return for when the further tax point occurs Returnable deposits You may ask your customers to pay a deposit when they hire goods from you You do not have to account for VAT if the deposit is either refunded in full to the customer when they return the goods safely kept by you to compensate you for loss or damage Read guidance manual VATSC05820 for more detailed information on the treatment of deposits for the supply of goods or services Section 7 of VAT Notice 7093 explains the VAT treatment of deposits for hotel accommodation Forfeit deposits If you ask your customer for a deposit against goods or services you will supply at a future date You must declare VAT on the deposit when you receive it or when you issue a VAT invoice whichever happens first If you keep a deposit if your customer decides not to take up the goods or service VAT remains due on the money you have received Using the cash accounting scheme If you use the cash accounting scheme you’ll account for the VAT when you receive payment from your customers unless it’s a returnable deposit Payments for continuous supplies If you supply services on a continuous basis and you receive regular or occasional payments a tax point is created every time you issue a VAT invoice or receive a payment whichever happens first If the payments are going to be made regularly you can issue a VAT invoice at the beginning of any period of up to a year for all the payments due in that period as long as there’s more than 1 payment due For each payment you should set out on the invoice the amount of the payment excluding VAT date the payment’s due rate of VAT amount of VAT payable If you decide to issue an invoice at the start of a period you do not have to account for VAT on any payment until either the date the payment’s due or the date you receive it whichever happens first The same procedures apply to continuous supplies of goods in the form of water gas and electricity If there’s a VAT rate change during the period covered by an invoice for continuous supplies you can declare VAT at the new rate on the part of the supply of goods or services you made after the rate change even though the normal tax point happened earlier For example where a payment is received before the goods or services are supplied If you decide to do this then you should declare VAT at the old rate on the value of the goods supplied or services performed before the change in rate and at the new rate after the rate changed If doing this reduces the amount of VAT due then you must issue a credit note to your customer Credit and conditional sales A ‘credit sale’ means the sale of goods which immediately become the property of your customer but where the price is paid to you in instalments A ‘conditional sale’ is where you supply goods to a customer but the goods remain your property until they’re paid for The tax point for a credit sale or a conditional sale is created at the time you supply the goods or services to your customer This is the basic tax point and is when you should account for the VAT on the full value of the goods This basic tax point may be overridden and an actual tax point created if you issue either a VAT invoice or receive payment before supplying the goods or services VAT invoice up to 14 days after the basic tax point If you use the cash accounting scheme goods that you sell under credit sale or conditional sale agreements are excluded from the scheme Credit sales where you provide finance to your customer If you offer goods on credit to your customer and you do not involve a finance company you’re financing the credit yourself If you show the credit charge separately on the invoice you issue to your customer then it will be exempt from VAT Other fees relating to the credit charge such as administration documentation or acceptance fees will also be exempt You declare VAT on the full value of the goods that you’ve supplied to your customer on the VAT Return for that period Additional fees relating to the goods such as fees for transferring the ownership of the goods to the customer are only exempt if the charge for them is 10 or less You might supply goods or services on interest free credit by arranging with your customer for them to pay over a set period without charging them interest In this case you declare VAT on the full selling price when you make the supplies Credit sales involving a finance company When you make credit sales involving a finance company the finance company either becomes the owner of the goods for example when a purchase is financed by a hirepurchase agreement doesn’t become the owner of the goods for example when a purchase is financed by a loan agreement Hire purchase agreements If the finance company becomes the owner of goods you’re supplying the goods to the finance company and not your customer You do not make a charge for providing the credit So you account for VAT on the value of the goods at the time you supply them to the finance company Any commission that you receive from the finance company for introducing them to your customer may be subject to VAT Loan agreements If the finance company does not become the owner of the goods you’re supplying goods directly to your customer You’re not supplying them to the finance company even though the finance company may pay you direct VAT is due on the selling price to your customer even if you receive a lower amount from the finance company The contract between your customer and the finance company for credit is a completely separate transaction Reclaiming VAT when you use different payment methods If you want to reclaim VAT on payments you’ve made to your suppliers you need to have a valid VAT invoice or receipt If a supplier gives you an invoice that covers several payments or an invoice showing monthly payments due in the forthcoming year you can only reclaim the VAT on the date each payment is due or the date you send the payment whichever happens first Updates to this page Published 1 July 2014

out what to do if you supply goods and services that are exempt from VAT and how these affect the amount of VAT you can reclaim on your purchases From HM Revenue Customs Published 1 July 2014 Last updated 18 May 2022 — See all updates Get emails about this page Contents Overview Exempt goods and services Exempt business Partly exempt business Land and buildings Acquiring or creating a capital asset If you move your own goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland Print this page Overview Some goods and services are exempt from VAT If all the goods and services you sell are exempt your business is exempt and you will not be able to register for VAT This means you cannot reclaim any VAT on your business purchases or expenses If you are VATregistered and incur VAT on any items that will be used to make exempt supplies you are classed as partly exempt Exempt goods and services There are some goods and services on which VAT is not charged including insurance finance and credit education and training fundraising events by charities subscriptions to membership organisations selling leasing and letting of commercial land and buildings — this exemption can be waived These items are exempt from VAT so are not taxable You do not include sales of exempt goods or services in your taxable turnover for VAT purposes And if you buy exempt items there is no VAT to reclaim Exempt items are different from zerorated supplies In both cases VAT is not added to the selling price but zerorated goods or services are taxable for VAT — at 0 Exempt business If you only sell or otherwise supply goods or services that are exempt from VAT then yours is an exempt business and you cannot register for VAT you cannot recover any VAT you incur on your purchases or expenses This is in contrast to where you sell or otherwise supply zerorated goods or services Here you can reclaim the VAT on any purchases that relate to those sales If you sell mainly or only zerorated items you can apply for an exemption from VAT registration If you are exempt from registration you will not be able to reclaim any VAT Read paragraph 311 of VAT Notice 7001 to find out how to apply Partly exempt business Your business is partly exempt if your business has incurred VAT on purchases that relate to exempt supplies This is known as exempt input tax Generally you will not be able to reclaim exempt input tax However provided the amount of exempt input tax is below a certain amount it can be recovered in full Nonbusiness use in a partly exempt business You cannot reclaim VAT you pay on goods and services that are not for business purposes If your business is partly exempt and you buy goods or services that you use partly for business and partly for nonbusiness purposes you must split the VAT accordingly You then use your partial exemption method in paragraph 39 of VAT Notice 706 to work out how much of the business VAT you can reclaim Keeping records if your business is partly exempt If you make both taxable and exempt supplies you must keep a separate record of your exempt sales and details of how you’ve worked out how much VAT to reclaim Land and buildings If you sell lease or let commercial land or property you can choose to waive the exemption and to charge VAT at the standard rate This is known as opting to tax land and buildings VAT incurred in making taxable supplies can be reclaimed Acquiring or creating a capital asset If you acquire or create an expensive capital asset you may have to use the Capital Goods Scheme to adjust how much input tax you initially reclaimed in future years The scheme applies when your capital spending net of VAT is 250000 or more on land or buildings or on building or civil engineering works 50000 or more on a single computer or piece of computer equipment 50000 or more on an aircraft ship boat or other vessel You’ll have to adjust the amount of VAT you reclaimed if your business has an asset and the extent to which you use it to make taxable supplies rather than exempt supplies varies over the following 5 or 10 years depending on the asset You can reclaim more if the proportion of your taxable supplies increases but you’ll have to repay some if it decreases If you move your own goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland If you move your own goods from Great Britain England Scotland and Wales to Northern Ireland you will usually be able to recover the full amount of VAT as if it had been a taxable supply However if you make supplies that are exempt from VAT you may not be able to recover some or all of the VAT on goods when they are first purchased If you then move the goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland you will incur a VAT charge You may also be further restricted in what input tax you can recover For example if you are making exempt supplies This will mean that you have incurred an input tax restriction twice on the same goods To prevent this you should reattribute the previously unrecovered input VAT on the original purchase in Great Britain as if the goods had been used for a taxable purchase You can do this when making your annual adjustment How to recover VAT on exempt supplies moved to Northern Ireland For example if you purchase goods that are valued at 10000 plus VAT of 2000 Because you are making exempt supplies only 1000 of the VAT is recoverable If you then move the goods to Northern Ireland you will be charged VAT of 2000 The partial exemption calculation at that time only permits 900 to be recovered This would mean you have paid 4000 VAT and only claimed 1900 as input tax To remedy this you should treat the movement as if it were a fully taxable supply This will allow you to recover the originally restricted input tax as being fully attributable to that taxable supply You can do this as part of your annual adjustment The VAT may be reclaimed subject to the normal rules Updates to this page Published 1 July 2014 Last updated 18 May 2022 show all updates 18

business can choose to pay import VAT on importation If you choose to do this you can reclaim the VAT incurred on the imported goods you own as input tax subject to the normal rules To claim input tax you will need the import VAT statement as evidence A shipping or forwarding agent cannot usually reclaim this input tax because the goods were not imported to be used in part of their business If you’re importing certain goods temporarily goods you intend to reexport within 2 years you can use temporary importation to get total or partial relief from import duties If you import goods temporarily but choose to put them into free circulation in the UK you’ll have to pay duty import VAT and compensatory interest for certain types of goods If you used delayed declarations by making an entry in your own records without authorisation and you are registered for VAT you must account for import VAT on your VAT Return If you are not VATregistered If you’re a UK trader and not registered for UK VAT you still have to pay the import VAT but you will not be able to reclaim it If you’re a nonUK trader and not registered for UK VAT you can arrange for an agent in the UK to import and supply goods on your behalf The agent’s supply of services to you will be at the standard rate of VAT which you will not be able to reclaim The agent will be able to recover the import VAT as input tax if they are an agent acting as principal under Section 47 of the VAT Act If you used delayed declarations by making an entry in your own records without authorisation and you are not registered

of Information releases and corporate reports Search Search GOVUK Search Home Money Business tax VAT Accounting for VAT Guidance VAT selfbilling arrangements How to set up a selfbilling arrangement between a VATregistered customer and their supplier and the conditions that have to be met From HM Revenue Customs Published 1 July 2014 Last updated 31 December 2020 — See all updates Get emails about this page Contents Overview If you are the customer If you’re a VATregistered supplier Detailed information about selfbilling Print this page Overview Selfbilling is an arrangement between a supplier and a customer Both customer and supplier must be VAT registered The customer prepares the supplier’s invoice and forwards a copy to the supplier with the payment If you want to put a selfbilling arrangement in place you do not have to tell HMRC or get approval from them You do have to get your supplier or customer to agree to the arrangement meet certain conditions If you are the customer Rules for selfbilling You can set up selfbilling arrangements with your suppliers as long as you can meet certain conditions you’ll need to enter into an agreement with each supplier review agreements with suppliers at regular intervals keep records of each of the suppliers who let you selfbill them make sure invoices contain the right information and are correctly issued Your suppliers do not have to be based just in the UK You can selfbill businesses in other countries You must not issue selfbilled invoices to a supplier who has changed their VAT registration number until you’ve prepared a new selfbilling agreement for them If a supplier stops being registered for VAT then you can continue to selfbill them but you cannot issue them with VAT invoices Your selfbilling arrangement with that supplier is no longer covered by the VAT regulations Reverse charge procedure There are special rules if you have a selfbilling arrangement and you are involved in transactions that the reverse charge arrangement for businesstobusiness supplies of mobile telephones and computer chips applies to Selfbilling agreements You can only have a selfbilling arrangement if your supplier agrees to put one in place If you do not have an agreement with your supplier your selfbilled invoices will not be valid VAT invoices – and you will not be able to reclaim the input tax shown on them You’ll both need to sign a formal selfbilling agreement This is a legally binding document The agreement must contain your supplier’s agreement that you as the selfbiller can issue invoices on your supplier’s behalf your supplier’s confirmation that they will not issue VAT invoices for goods or services covered by the agreement because you’ll be issuing the invoices for them an expiry date – usually for 12 months time but it could be the date that any business contract you have with your supplier ends your supplier’s agreement that they’ll let you know if they stop being registered for VAT get a new VAT registration number or transfer their business as a going concern details of any third party you intend to outsource the selfbilling process to You’ll need to set up a new agreement if your supplier transfers their business as a going concern and both you and the new business owner want to carry on with selfbilling Bear in mind that countries can set their own conditions for selfbilling So you’ll need to make sure that any agreement you draw up for a supplier in another country meets those conditions as well If an HMRC officer wants to see the agreement you must show it to them Reviewing selfbilling agreements Selfbilling agreements usually last for 12 months At the end of this you’ll need to review the agreement to make sure you can prove to HMRC that your supplier agrees to accept the selfbilling invoices you issue on their behalf It’s very important that you do not selfbill a supplier when you do not have their written agreement to do so You will not normally need to review an agreement if you provide selfbilled invoices to a supplier for less than 12 months Record keeping If you are a selfbiller you’ll need to keep certain records These are copies of the agreements you make with your suppliers the names addresses and VAT registration numbers of the suppliers who have agreed that you can selfbill them You’ll still be responsible for keeping these records if you outsource selfbilling to a third party provider If you do not keep the required records then the selfbilled invoices you issue will not be proper VAT invoices Selfbilling invoices Once you’ve got a selfbilling agreement with a supplier you must issue selfbilled invoices for all the transactions with them during the period of the agreement As well as all the details that must go on a full VAT invoice you’ll also need to include your supplier’s name address VAT registration number All selfbilled invoices must include the statement ‘The VAT shown is your output tax due to HMRC’ Remember that you do not add any VAT to selfbilled invoices that you issue to suppliers who are not VAT registered Reclaiming input tax You’ll only be able to reclaim the input tax shown on selfbilled invoices if you meet all the record keeping requirements When you can reclaim the input tax depends on the date when the supply of the goods or services takes place for VAT purposes Normally the date of supply for VAT purposes is the actual date when the goods or services are provided to you the customer But if you issue a selfbilled invoice within 14 days of this date of supply then the date you issue the invoice becomes the date of the transaction for VAT purposes This determines which VAT Return you put the transaction on and if there is a VAT rate change it determines which VAT rate applies to the invoice If you’re a VATregistered supplier Setting up a selfbilling arrangement If one of your customers wants to set up a selfbilling arrangement with you they’ll ask you to agree to this in writing If you agree they’ll give you a selfbilling agreement to sign The terms of the agreement are a matter between you and your customer but there are certain conditions you’ll both have to meet to make sure you comply with VAT regulations For VAT purposes you’ll have to do all of the following sign and keep a copy of the selfbilling agreement agree not to issue any sales invoices to your customer for any transaction during the period of the agreement agree to accept the selfbilling invoices that your customer issues tell your customer at once if you change your VAT registration number cancel your VAT registration or transfer your business as a going concern Accounting for the output tax The VAT figure on the selfbilled invoice your customer sends you is your output tax When you have to account for this to HMRC depends on the date of supply of the goods or services for VAT purposes This date of supply is normally the date when you actually provide the goods or services to your customer so you might have to account for the VAT before you’ve received the selfbilled invoice or been paid You are accountable to HMRC for output tax on the supplies you make to your customer so you should check that your customer is applying the correct rate of VAT on the invoices they send you If there has been a VAT rate change you will need to check that the correct rate has been used If you’re a supplier who receives electronic selfbilled invoices from a customer in another country you’ll need to make sure that they issue the invoices in a format that’s acceptable to HMRC your accounting systems can accept the invoices Take care not to treat selfbilled invoices as purchase invoices and reclaim the VAT shown as your input tax If you do incorrectly treat the VAT as input tax you’ll have to correct the mistake Detailed information about selfbilling Find out how customers and their suppliers must treat VAT if they’re using selfbilling arrangements in VAT Notice 70062

customers How to account for VAT if you make supplies to your customers and you pay certain costs that you pass on when you invoice them From HM Revenue Customs Published 1 July 2014 Get emails about this page Contents Overview Disbursements costs to exclude from VAT calculations What isn’t a disbursement Showing disbursements and recharges on your invoices When you can claim back VAT When you can’t claim back VAT What records you need to keep for VAT Recharges Print this page Overview When you make payments on behalf of your customers for goods or services received and used by them you might be able to treat these payments as ‘disbursements’ for VAT purposes This means that you don’t charge VAT on them when you invoice your customer can’t claim back any VAT on them This guide explains when you should charge VAT on the costs and expenses you pass to your customers payments like these can be treated as disbursements Disbursements costs to exclude from VAT calculations A payment made to suppliers on behalf of your customers is called a ‘disbursement’ if you pass the cost on to your customers when you invoice them You might be able to leave out these payments from your VAT calculations because it’s the customer not you who buys and receives the goods or services you’re just acting as their agent To treat a payment as a disbursement all of the following must apply you paid the supplier on your customer’s behalf and acted as the agent of your customer your customer received used or had the benefit of the goods or services you paid for on their behalf it was your customer’s responsibility to pay for the goods or services not yours you had permission from your customer to make the payment your customer knew that the goods or services were from another supplier not from you you show the costs separately on your invoice you pass on the exact amount of each cost to your customer when you invoice them the goods and services you paid for are in addition to the cost of your own services It’s usually only an advantage to treat a payment as a disbursement if the supplier didn’t charge VAT on it or if your customer can’t reclaim the VAT What isn’t a disbursement There are many incidental costs your business might incur that must be included in VAT calculations when you invoice customers These include items like travelling expenses and your own postage and delivery costs Costs that your business incurs itself when supplying goods or services to customers are not disbursements for VAT It’s you who buys the goods or services for use in your own business It’s up to you whether or not you itemise costs like these on your invoices If you do show them separately when you invoice your customers they’re known as ‘recharges’ and not disbursements You’ll have to charge VAT on them whether you paid any VAT or not Some examples of costs that could be recharges but are not disbursements include an airline ticket that you buy to visit a client or to travel to a job if you recharge the cost to your client you must charge VAT because the flight was for you not for the client postage costs you incur when you send letters to your customers these are normal business costs and you must add VAT if you recharge them a bank transfer fee paid when transferring money from your business account to a client’s account even though the bank’s fee is exempt from VAT if you recharge the fee you must charge VAT because it was for a service provided to your business and not to your customer Showing disbursements and recharges on your invoices If you exclude disbursements from the VAT calculations you must itemise them separately on your VAT invoices An example of an invoice showing disbursements and recharges A website design consultant based in London does a week’s work for a client in Edinburgh The consultant visits the client’s premises at the start of the week to discuss the project The consultant also agrees to purchase a website hosting package from an Internet service provider on behalf of the client The consultant and the client agree the following fees Activity Fee Consultant’s work 2500 plus VAT Consultant’s travelling expenses 300 Website hosting package purchased on the client’s behalf 150 The 300 travel cost that the consultant recharges to the client is not a disbursement so the consultant must charge VAT on it But the cost of the website hosting package is a disbursement and can be excluded from the VAT calculation because it was purchased for the use of the client the client agreed that the consultant would arrange and pay for it on their behalf this means the consultant agreed to act as the client’s agent the consultant passed the whole 150 charge on to the client without adding anything as a separate item on the invoice it was the client’s responsibility to pay for the goods the consultant had permission from his client to make the payment the client knew the web hosting package was from another supplier and not from the consultant the consultant showed the costs separately in the invoice the web hosting package paid for by the consultant is additional to the other services being billed to the client The consultant’s invoice to their client for this work might include the following items design services 2500 travelling expenses 300 amount on which VAT is due 2800 VAT at 20 560 disbursements 150 total including VAT 3510 When you can claim back VAT If you had to charge VAT on items you paid for because they were supplied to you and not to your client you can claim back any VAT you paid on them It makes no difference whether or not you passed these costs on to your customers as recharges You’ll need a VAT invoice for each item you claim the VAT back on Your customer will also be able to claim back the VAT you charged them if they’re VATregistered When you can’t claim back VAT If you paid a VATregistered supplier for goods or services on a customer’s behalf there may have been VAT on what they charged You can’t claim this VAT back if the goods or services were supplied to your customer and not to your business and you treated this as a disbursement for VAT purposes when you invoiced your customer and did not charge VAT Your customer may also be unable to claim back the VAT if they don’t have a valid VAT invoice for the goods or services What records you need to keep for VAT If you pass on any disbursements to your customers and don’t charge VAT on them you must keep evidence such as order forms and invoices to show that you were entitled to leave the items out of the VAT calculation when you invoiced your customers You must also be able to show that you haven’t claimed back the VAT on items you paid for on your customers’ behalf Recharges To claim back the VAT on costs and expenses you pass on to your customers as recharges you’ll need a valid VAT invoice or receipt for each Help HMRC to improve this

works out your payments the alternatives and how and when to pay From HM Revenue Customs Published 7 December 2017 Last updated 11 December 2023 — See all updates Get emails about this page Contents Payments on account arrangements Payment due dates How to pay Changes in your VAT liability Alternatives to payments on account Print this page Payments on account arrangements ‘Payments on account’ are advance payments towards your VAT bill HMRC will tell you to make payments on account if you send VAT returns quarterly and you owe more than 23 million in any period of 12 months or less The 23 million threshold includes VAT on imports and moving goods into and out of excise warehouses How we work out your ‘payments on account’ We’ll work out your payments based on your annual VAT liability in the period that you go over the threshold We’ll divide your annual VAT liability in that period by 24 to arrive at an instalment amount If you’ve been in business for less than 12 months we’ll work out the payments as a proportion We do not include the VAT on imports and moving goods into and out of excise warehouses We may change the amount of your payments if your total VAT liability goes up or down by 20 or more Businesses registered in divisions If you’ve registered your business in the names of its divisions we’ll look at each division as a separate business for payments on account We’ll use the VAT liability of each division to decide whether it should make payments on account the amount of each payment on account Businesses registered as part of a VAT group We’ll look at the VAT liability of the whole group to decide whether it should make payments on account the amount of each payment on account A VAT group will have a representative member that’s responsible for making payments on account for the group If we do not get the payments all members of the group are jointly and severally responsible for payments on account this means the group members are responsible together and individually responsible for the group payments Payments on account start date and annual cycle The payments on account cycle starts in the first quarter after you go over the 23 million threshold Your payments will stay the same until the start of the next annual cycle The annual cycle begins in April May or June depending on which VAT return ‘stagger’ you’re on We base the amount of your payments during the annual cycle on your liability in the period known as the ‘reference year’ Reference years This table sets out the reference year for each return stagger Stagger Quarter ends Reference year Annual cycle begins 1 March June September December Year ending September April of following year 2 April July October January Year ending October May of following year 3 May August November February Year ending November June of following year So if you’re on stagger 1 your VAT liability for the reference year ending September 2018 will decide the amount of each payment on account from April 2019 until March 2020 Payment due dates We’ll write to you with a payment schedule telling you how much to pay and all your payment deadlines Make sure cleared funds are in HMRC’s bank account by the deadline or you may get a late payment penalty or be charged late payment interest If the deadline falls on a weekend or bank holiday your payment must clear HMRC’s bank account on the last working day before it unless you pay by Faster Payments Due dates for payments on account The due dates for payments on account are the last working day of the second and third months of every VAT quarter no matter what your period end date is The 7 day extension for paying electronically does not apply to payments on account Payments on account that are not paid on time will be subject to late payment interest Due dates for quarterly balancing payments Your balancing payments are due with your VAT return and must clear our bank account by the last working day of the month if

is or will be less than 80 of the liability we used to calculate your current payments you can ask us to reduce them This applies to either any completed year ending after the year that we’ve based current payments on a backward look at your VAT liability any year that’s started but not yet ended a forward look and you must include an estimate of future returns you’ll submit to make up the whole year In both cases write to the payments on account team Tell us the reasons we should reduce your payments If we’re satisfied we’ll change your payments to show your reduced VAT liability Higher payments on account We may increase your payments on account if the VAT liability for any year after the year we based our calculations on increases by 20 or more We’ll tell you in writing about an increase in payments If we’ve increased your payments you can apply to have the payments reduced to show your current liability as long as you meet the conditions for a lower payment We’ll use the year that we worked out your payments to decide if you meet these conditions Removal from a payments on account arrangement If your VAT liability falls below 23 million in your reference year we’ll remove you from the arrangement 6 months later For example If your reference year ends in September and your liability is below the threshold at that point your last payment on account will be in the following March But you must carry on making payments on account until then We’ll tell you the effective date of your withdrawal from your payments on account arrangement If your total VAT liability within any completed year ending after your reference year falls below 18 million you can ask the payments on account team in writing to remove you from the arrangement Give all the reasons why we

arrangement will continue Alternatives to payments on account Monthly returns If making payments on account and submitting quarterly VAT returns does not suit your business you can choose to make VAT returns and payments monthly To make the change to monthly returns you can either apply online to change your registration details fill in form VAT 484 and send it to the address on the form You might have to continue making monthly returns for at least one year If you submit monthly VAT returns you may be allowed up to 7 extra days to pay and submit your VAT return as long as you use an electronic payment method This is the only circumstance that a business in a payments on account arrangement can be given the extension to the due date for payment If you move back from monthly returns to quarterly returns the 7 day extension will not apply and you must make payments on account from the first quarterly accounting period Actual monthly liability Instead of paying the amounts we told you to or moving to monthly returns you can choose to pay the actual liability for the previous month without submitting a monthly VAT return For example the payment due at the end of February will be the actual liability for January This option may suit you if you have wide seasonal variations in turnover But if you opt to pay the actual liability you must do so for at least one year If you do opt to pay actual monthly liabilities but you’re in credit for any month you will not get an immediate repayment but should bring the credit forward to the VAT return as normal cannot net off the credit in one month against the liability for the next month to reduce the amount of payment should consider switching to monthly returns if you’re often in credit and you want immediate repayments of credit If you want to use actual monthly liability contact the payments on account team Removing the option to pay actual monthly liabilities You must make accurate payments of your monthly liabilities If we’re not satisfied that you are we’ll tell you that you can no longer pay the actual monthly liability and we may direct you to make monthly returns or go back to the payments on account we worked out for you Disagreements If you disagree with our decision to remove the option to pay actual monthly liabilities you can either ask the payments on account team for a review in writing appeal to an the tax
