We have offered a quotation and issued a policy on the \nunderstanding that at the time of purchasing this insurance you are fit to travel and are not currently suffering a decline in health that \ncould reasonably cause you to cancel a trip or make a claim. Additionally, that you have declared all pre-existing medical conditions \nrelevant to the questions that were asked through the booking process, whether on line or through the call centre, and that all the answers \ngiven in relation to the specific medical conditions that you have declared are accurate. \nIt is important that you are aware that we do not offer the option of partial cover, as this will not allow us to adequately assess your health \nrisk from an insurance perspective. \nTelling us about some but not all of your pre-existing medical conditions may result in us not collecting the correct premium to cover you \nas an individual for health related claims; this may also result in us issuing a policy where, had we been informed of all the facts, we \nwould not have offered a policy at all. \nFor this reason claims related to non-disclosed pre-existing medical conditions will not be paid and claims relating to declared medical \nconditions or new medical conditions, may be proportionately reduced or declined in full if we establish that you have told us about some, \nbut not all your pre-existing medical conditions or provided us with inaccurate information. \nThis document records the medical conditions that you have told us about, to ensure that you are properly protected in the event of a \nhealth related claim, please carefully review the declaration below and contact us immediately if the declaration is either incomplete or \ninaccurate. \nPersonal Details: \nName: Dr Benjamin Klein \nDate of birth: 21/10/1992 \nDeclared Medical Conditions: \nMedical Condition: \nDate of screening: \nStatus: \n10/10/2024 \nCovered \n--Condition: Anxiety \nHave you been treated for depression within the last 2 years? - No \nHave you been referred to a psychiatrist for this condition within the last 2 years?
